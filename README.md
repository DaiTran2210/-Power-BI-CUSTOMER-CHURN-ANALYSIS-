# [Power BI] CUSTOMER CHURN ANALYSIS
## I. Introduction
### 1. Introduction to Dataset
- User churn happens when customers stop using a product or service over time, which can have a negative impact on the business.
- Figuring out why users churn is super important because it helps companies come up with better ways to keep their customers happy and improve what they offer.
- This dataset includes a dim table with details about users of a telecommunications network company, like demographic information and insights about user churn.

- Build a dashboard for managers that gives a clear overview of user churn status and highlights which users are part of the churn group.
- Come up with creative solutions to tackle the issue and help reduce user churn.

## IV. Insights
- Competitors are offering better deals and prices compared to our company.  
- Our customer service needs improvement—customers who churn tend to call customer service more often, with an average of 2.4 calls compared to the norm.  
- Customers using 0–10 GB of monthly data but subscribing to the Unlimited Data plan are more likely to churn than others.  
- Customers on "month-to-month" contracts have a significantly high churn rate of nearly 90%.
## V. Recommendations

- Focus on improving customer service by streamlining the problem-solving process—help customers quickly and avoid situations where they have to call multiple times to get an issue resolved.
- Provide both online and phone support to address customer concerns more effectively.
- Offer special incentives for customers on month-to-month contracts, like top-up bonuses or discounted data packages, to keep them engaged.
- Rework the Unlimited Data plan to either lower the price or create a better value data package tailored for customers using 0–10 GB monthly.
- Introduce exciting offers for new customers, but don’t forget to reward loyal customers with meaningful incentives. Since 45% of churn happens because competitors have better deals, we need to stand out with both competitive pricing and great customer appreciation programs.
